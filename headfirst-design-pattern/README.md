# Head First Design Pattern 책 학습 내용

## Design Principles

### 전략패턴 Strategy Pattern

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to an interface, not an implementation

### 옵저버 패턴 Observer Pattern : one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its

dependents are notified and updated automatically

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

### Decorator Pattern

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- "Beverages with added condiments"

### Factory

- relies on INHERITANCE
- to allow a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses

### Abstract Factory

- relies on COMPOSITION
- to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes

### Singleton

### Command Pattern

- Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log
  requests, and support undoable operations
- used in queuing requests && logging queues
## Keynotes

- the only constant in software is **change**
