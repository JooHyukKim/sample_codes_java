### # Design Principles

**전략패턴 Strategy Pattern**

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to an interface, not an implementation

**옵저버 패턴 Observer Pattern** : one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its
dependents are notified and updated automatically

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

### # Key notes

- the only constant in software is **change**

// 1 appear // 2 encapsulate // 3 composition
